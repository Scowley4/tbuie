# TBUIE

This is demo of the interactive topic modeling capabilities of
[ankura](https://github.com/byu-aml-lab/ankura).

On the name: I'm not a front end guy. I don't have a clue what I'm doing here.
This started out as a text box where you entered in raw json into a text box
and hit a button to replace that json with the results...it was sardonically
called the best UI ever and the name stuck. To be fair, the UI has come a
little ways since then, but not much...
